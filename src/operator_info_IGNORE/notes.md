## First pass generation of code

- 16 total hours
- Architected with Claude Opus
- Tests and code generated with OAI Codex

### Issues

- Event bus vs. Node Event Emitter use inconsistent (Codex did not integrate information from Integration_Protocol for the first 5 modules)
- Fleet and Game Board seem to have overlapping functionality
- No HTML generated; user-initialized DOM events not taken into account
- Some overlapping functionality (to be expected)
- Some functionality and variables unused -- artifact of over-engineered arch procedure

#### GameController

- initializeGame() missing random ship placement
